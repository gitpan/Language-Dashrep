Language::Dashrep

Dashrep is a versatile descriptive programming language based on hyphenated phrases (such as "rectangle-outline-attention-begin") being successively expanded into replacement text.  The resulting expanded text can be an HTML web page, an XML file, a JavaScript program, a boilerplate-based document, etc.  It is a much more flexible alternative to using a template language.  See www.Dashrep.org for details.
